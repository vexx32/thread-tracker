Titi can help keep track of your to do list! To Do list entries will also be shown when listing threads, and can occupy the same categories as your normal threads.

Note that using categories with to do-list items requires you prefix the category with `!`, for example `!Bob`.

> **`tt!todos`** — List all to do-list entries.
> **`tt!todo`** _`!category`_ `todo text` — Add a to do-list item, optionally with a category.
> **`tt!done`** `todo text` — Remove a to do-list entry.
> **`tt!done`** `!category` — Remove all to do-list entries from the given category.
> **`tt!done !all`** — Remove all to do entries.
