When using a bot like [Tupperbox](https://tupperbox.app), which lets you send responses from the bot under specific names, Titi can't normally tell which responses are from you. Registering a muse name lets Titi know which responses are yours.

When listing threads (`tt!help threads`), Titi will list the person who last responded to a thread in bold if it isn't you or one of your muses. It'll also ensure that Titi picks threads that you haven't responded to when using `/tt!random`.

> **`/tt!muses`** — List the currently registered muses
> **`/tt!addmuse`** `name` — Register a muse name
> **`/tt!removemuse`** `name` — Remove a registered muse name
