If you come across a bug in Thread Tracker, you can ask Titi to report it directly on GitHub for you!

Please include as much information and context as you can and are comfortable with. Linebreaks and normal Markdown formatting is allowed. Ideally, include the following:

- Reproduction steps
- Screenshots or videos of the behaviour or responses (either as attachments to the command message or just links)
- Any other relevant details you can think of!

> **`tt!bug`** `report text` - Sends a direct bug report, optionally along with a screenshot.

## Example

> ```
> tt!bug short description of the error / report title
> When I do X and then Y and Z, Titi gives me this error
> (attached screenshots)
> ```

Bug reports will include all the provided information, in addition to your Discord user ID, in case we need to ask follow up questions to get things fixed.

**Please don't abuse this functionality**, it exists purely to make it easier to report issues and get them fixed.
