If you come across a bug in Thread Tracker, you can ask Titi to report it for you! Bug reports can also be submitted on the [Thread Tracker Github](https://github.com/vexx32/thread-tracker).

Please include as much information and context as you can and are comfortable with. Linebreaks and normal Markdown formatting are allowed. Ideally, include the following:

- Reproduction steps
- Screenshots or videos of the behaviour or responses (either as attachments to the command message or just links)
- Any other relevant details you can think of!

> **`tt!bug`** `report text` - Sends a direct bug report, optionally along with screenshots.

__**Example**__
```
tt!bug short description of the error / report title
When I do X and then Y and Z, Titi gives me this error
(attached screenshots)
```

Bug reports will include all the provided information, in addition to your Discord user ID, in case we need to ask follow up questions to get things fixed. Reports made with `tt!bug` are not public, although relevant information from the report may be captured in a GitHub issue if it can't be fixed quickly.

**Please don't abuse this functionality**, it exists purely to make it easier to report issues and get them fixed.
